# WordlistCraft

Many users, including system administrators, tend to create passwords by modifying familiar words—such as names, dates, or job titles—using predictable patterns like leetspeak, capitalization, and common suffixes. This script automates the generation of password wordlists based on those behaviors. By providing one or more base words, the tool outputs a comprehensive set of possible mutations that reflect real-world password creation habits. It’s designed for use in password audits, red team operations, and targeted wordlist crafting during penetration tests.
